<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samiksha Sharma. I am 20 years old and currently pursuing B.Tech from Accurate Institute of Management and Technology. I am in my second year, and I have recently developed a strong interest in web development. Technology has always fascinated me, and I love the idea of creating websites and applications that people can use in their daily lives. I believe web development is a great skill that will help me build a good career in the IT field.</p>

<p>I started learning web development recently. At first, I began with HTML and CSS, which are the basic building blocks of any website. Then I moved on to JavaScript to make web pages more interactive. I am also exploring tools like Bootstrap and learning about how websites work on different devices. It feels exciting to create something and see it working on the browser. I try to practice regularly and watch online tutorials to improve my skills. Every day, I learn something new and feel more confident.</p>

<p>In the future, I want to become a professional web developer and work in a good company. I also wish to build my own websites and projects that can solve real-life problems. This is just the beginning, but I am motivated to work hard and keep learning. I know the journey will not always be easy, but I am ready to face the challenges and improve step by step. I am focused on building a strong foundation so I can achieve my goals in the tech world.
